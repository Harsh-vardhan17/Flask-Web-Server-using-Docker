# Flask-Web-Server-using-Docker

## This project is a simple Flask web server containerized with Docker. The goal is to create a minimal web server application using Flask (a Python web framework) and deploy it in a Docker container. This setup is ideal for beginners looking to understand how Docker works with Flask applications and how to expose applications from containers to be accessible via a browser.

## Project Overview

This project consists of a simple "Hello, World!" web application built with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. The application is containerized with Docker, which allows it to be run in isolated containers across different environments without worrying about system dependencies.


### Key Features

- A basic Flask application that responds with "Hello, World from Flask!" on the homepage.
- Dockerized for easy deployment and isolation from the host system.
- Exposes port 5000 on the local machine to access the application via `localhost:5000` in a web browser.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: Programming language for the web application.
- **Flask**: Python web framework for building web servers.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool to package the application and its dependencies.
